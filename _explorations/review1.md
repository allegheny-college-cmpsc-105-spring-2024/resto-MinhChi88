[Waffle-tastic Food Truck](https://allegheny-college-cmpsc-105-spring-2024.github.io/resto-tetlow01 ) is so so so adorable. The taste of the waffle is unique. It gives the right amount of crunchy. Besides, there are many options to chose. However, I would recommend people try their Waffle Sunday. IT GIVES AN OMG VIBES. I would come back again just for the Waffle Sunday. Besides, the owner is super nice and friendly. She was so patient even though I was getting weird because it took me forever to firgue out what I want to order. A plus for this food truck is the price is too reasonable. All items are $6 which is crazy cheap. I would give this truck food 10 out of 10. I hope it comes back to Pittsburgh soon so I can have Waffle Sunday again. Hurra!
