[Colin’s Pizzeria](https://allegheny-college-cmpsc-105-spring-2024.github.io/resto-colinelder/) literally changed my whole mind about pizza. I was used to hate pizza so much because I did not think that It tasted good. I went to the restaurant last Monday and it was DELICIOUS!!!!! The menu is not diverse but the taste made up everything. I ordered Margharita pizza and Pasta Carbonara. They are all so good. They did not over seasoning anything. Everything was just about right. My fiance, who is the pickiest person in this whole planet, can't stop giving them compliments so you all know that this place is legit. The price is reasonable. However, I wish the pasta was a little bit bigger because it was pretty small to compare to $26 but the tatse was so good so I did not complain much about it. I have been to Italia before and I can confirm that the taste is authentic. Not gonna lie. Besides, the restaurant decoration is also a plus. It is a small cute little restaurant in the corner of the road by my apartment. It looks cozy and gives you the comfortable vibe. I enjoyed being there. People were nice to us to. Really sweet!
