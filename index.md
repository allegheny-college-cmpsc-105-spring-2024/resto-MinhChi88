###  <span style="color:Purple"> Why do we only do gel?

<span style="color:Pink"> At our nail studio, we use different kind of gel to perform different services. For instance, we use hard gel to perform extensions or overlay to help protect your nails from breaking. Besides, gel is flexible and glossy but still provide enough protection for your natural nails. Especially, even the thickest gel, hard gel, is still very light on your hand.
For acrylics, you need monomer liquid to perform which causes awful smell. However, gel does not smell like anything.
